When? – On Polling Day? At work? After work? Before the wedding?

How? – In person? By post? By telephone? Remote polling? Mobile polling?

Who? – Self? Family member? Relative?

## Project Ideation and considerations: 
Voting capability/capacity should be online. Banking is.

Voting likely to increase if electronic

Encouraging persons not to vote at the booths

Provide citizens with behaviours, etc on safest actions whilst voting

Incorporating an Early Voter Application Form directly submitted to the WA Electoral Commision

Accessible in variety of languages and video supports in Auslan, LOTE, etc

Identification of language-supported booths determined by ABS Data Sets

Identification of accessible friendly locations (International Standard graphics indicating friendly)

Candidate profiles, statements and videos (i.e. 3 mins max) with closed caption subtitles in all languages.

Pre-book attendance to expedite those requiring assistance or noise-friendly times (i.e. shopping hours dedicated to elderly, disabled, etc during COVID).

Democracy sausage locations with pre-purchase functionality.

## COVID hotspots (integrated with local Department of Health (or similar authority) data)

## Recent Elections 
What Works

Distance 2 meters

Wearing masks

Alcohol-based hand sanitiser

BYO pens/pencil (specify colour/s, pencil hardness)


## What Does Not Work
Big queues outside the voting places (people waiting in hot weather or rain)

During pademy the postal services were limited and not all voters received their voting packages. When they received them, sometimes it was too late to send them back 

Too slow process from coming to the voting place to voting and leaving the place - due to the limit of people who can be inside at the same time

Not everyone keeping the distance

## What Would Make It Better

Voting online

More voting places in areas with higher number of people

More efficient voting via post

Ensuring that voters overseas will be able to vote (a lot of people did not manage to vote)

## Functionality
Check where to vote, how and what is needed

Provide safety measures

Where to buy a democracy sausage and who it supports (complete with prepayment to minimise cash handling)
